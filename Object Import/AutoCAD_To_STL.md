# Exporting STL files from AutoCad

## AutoCAD

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) is used to create precise 2D drawings for many uses. It can be used for 3D design but may not be the first choice to create those assets. AutoCAD is my go-to application to create 2D geometry for laser cutting.
