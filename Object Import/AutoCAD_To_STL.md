# Exporting STL files from AutoCad

## AutoCAD

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) is used to create precise 2D drawings. It is my go-to application to create 2D geometry for laser cutting.

AutoCAD can also be utilized to produce complex and precise 3D drawings for architecture and engineering. For many of my own projects I need to create 3D assets from existing 2D drawings. One particular purpose are 3D visualizations of IoT projects, before any laser cut is made.

In this case the 2D line drawing of a specific object in AutoCAD has to be transformed into a 3D object. This sounds like a relatively straight forward procedure; in a dedicated 3D application, such as Blender, one would use an *extrude* function to add "thickness" to a surface. Of course AutoCAD also has an *extrude* command and applied to a \properly\ constructed 2D object it will yield useable results.
