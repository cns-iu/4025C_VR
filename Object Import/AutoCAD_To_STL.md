# Exporting STL files from AutoCad

## AutoCAD

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) is used to create precise 2D drawings. It is my go-to application to create 2D geometry for laser cutting.

AutoCAD can help to produce complex and precise 3D drawings for architecture and engineering. For many of my projects I need to create 3D assets to be used in more artistic rendering environments. One particular purpose are 3D visualizations of IoT projects, before any laser cut is made.
