## General Information

Many kinds of software can be used for the creation of 3D models. As long as the created files are always saved and opened by the same application, the process is transparent. Content creators like (or have) to work with different 3D applications. For example such programs as Autodesk Maya, Blender or Cinema 4D are good choices to create 3D assets. All of them have various scripting capabilities. They are complex and therefore present a pretty steep learning curve. All these applications share a core set of abilities, though each might have different specialities. The way a user interacts with any of these applications, however, can be vastly different from program to program. As a consequence, knowing how to work in one program fluently doesn't necessarily mean a user can apply this to one of the other programs. 

A project might start out as a hand drawing, scanned into the computer and then used as a template to make a 2D line drawing in AutoCAD. 





## About the Applications

### AutoCAD

AutoCAD is used to create precise 2D drawings for many uses. Although it can be used for 3D constructing it is not a first choice to create those assets. 

### Blender

### Maya

### Cinema 4D
